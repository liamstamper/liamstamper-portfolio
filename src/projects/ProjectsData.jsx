Players can navigate using standard WASD controls and interact with enemies and the environment. A HUD displays the player's health and level, while a gun and hand representation are visible on the screen to mimic the Doom gameplay style. Players can toggle a minimap during gameplay, helping them navigate the ASCII-rendered levels. This minimap shows the playerâ€™s location and the positions of enemies.",

I added simple enemy behavior where enemies roam the map with randomized movements. Although basic, this feature adds another layer to the gameplay. Iexpanded the project to support multiple map sizes. Each map offers a unique layout keeing the game interesting. Most recently I added a HUD that displays the player's health and current level.",
